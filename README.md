# Magento CR Tracking module

Magento 1.9 module that helps set up Google and Bing conversion tracking for your website.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repo and copy the app folder to your Magento installation.
2. Log into your website's admin panel (if you are already logged in, you might have to log out and log back in).
3. Go to System - Configuration. In the left menu, there should be a group called "Upment". Click on "CR Tracking" inside that group.
4. Enter GTag Conversion ID, Bing Tag ID and allowed domain. (Module is comparing this value to the current website domain and it only works if they are equal.)
5. Save Config and Flush Magento Cache.
